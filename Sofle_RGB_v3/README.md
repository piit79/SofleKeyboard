![Sofle RGB v3 PCB](https://github.com/piit79/SofleKeyboard/blob/sofle_rgb_v3/Sofle_RGB_v3/PCB/SofleKeyboard_RGB_v3.png?raw=true)

This is a variation of the Sofle RGB with the more aggressive "pinky stagger" of the Sofle v2, plus a few other modifications:

* Support for a SMD power switch
* Battery connector next to the controller footprint (intended for a small battery that fits underneath the controller)
